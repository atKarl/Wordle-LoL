# Trundle
If you want to try the game, click [Trundle](https://trundle.atkarl.xyz)

Trundle is a wordle-like game based on the universe of League of Legends.
The goal is to find the name of a champion daily, in the least amount of tries.

For any question, you can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/KarlEmmanuel_)


The length of the daily champion's name is not always the same, to add some more challenge.

## Why this project

The project is written in Vanilla JS with HTLM and CSS, it was a mean for me to apply the things I learned until now.

## Future

As is it right now, the project and its structure is rather simple. It will most likely evolve as I learn more about React and frontend web development.
